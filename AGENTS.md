# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

## Unslop every message (always on)

Before you send any message to Ben, run the `unslop` skill on it. This applies to every model and agent working in this repo: Claude, Codex, Cursor, Gemini and any other.

- Claude Code: invoke `/unslop` (`.claude/skills/unslop/SKILL.md`).
- Other agents: read `.agents/skills/unslop/SKILL.md` and apply its rules.
- Scope: chat replies, summaries, plans, PR descriptions and any prose written for Ben. Leave code, command output and quoted text unchanged.
- Run the pass silently. Send only the cleaned text, not a before/after or a list of fixes.

## Write PRs with pr-writer (always on)

Whenever you create or edit a pull request in this repo, write its title and description with the `pr-writer` skill. This applies to every model and agent working in this repo: Claude, Codex, Cursor, Gemini and any other.

- Claude Code: invoke `/pr-writer` (`.claude/skills/pr-writer/SKILL.md`).
- Other agents: read `.agents/skills/pr-writer/SKILL.md` and follow it.
- A PR template in `.github/` keeps its structure. Fill it in the pr-writer style.
